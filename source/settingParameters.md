Setting Model Parameters
========================

Note: Setting model parameters and running simulations are only possible
in Geppetto deployments that support these functionalities.

Prior to running an experiment you can modify the values of any parameter in your model using the control panel (see [basics](usinggeppetto.html) for a review of the control panel).

The parameters tab in the control panel is signified by ![](images/parameter.png). Use the search filter to find parameters quickly. Any adjusted values will be highlighted in yellow.
Please note that parameters can only be edited when the project is persisted (if your deployment uses the persistence bundle) and when the active experiment is in the design stage.
