Styling the Geppetto Frontend using LESS and CSS
================================================

Last Update: January 24th 2015

This section provides information on how to style the geppetto frontend
using CSS and LESS. Currently, GEPPETTO uses LESS styling sheets to give
the frontend components their current look. Each component has a
corresponding LESS file, which is also referenced from inside the
main.less file. During development stages, the LESS files will be used,
but CSS files will be used during production. Building the frontend
using "mvn clean install -P master" will create a file CSS file from the
LESS components.

The structure of CSS and LESS files looks something like this, and this
is how you can expect to find the files inside the frontend bundle.

:

:   css

    > main.css

    less

    > components
    >
    > > button.less
    >
    > main.less

If you were to make changes to button.less file, the changes would be
reflected on the frontend when running it using the LESS files, but
would not be reflected if pointing to the main.css file. The build using
the "-P master" flag would be required to compile LESS files into CSS.

The CSS styling sheets for plugin components can be found inside the css
directory, these are not part of LESS and are used as provided by their
corresponding plugin (font-awesome, codemirror, qunit, jsConsole etc)
