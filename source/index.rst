Introduction
============

Geppetto is a web based platform made to empower you to **explore, visualize and simulate complex biological models** such as a **cell** or even a **whole brain**.

Geppetto's goal is to make it easy to work in an integrated fashion with different types of data, whether they come from a simulation, an experiment or a clinical study.

Since Geppetto is a web application users don't need to install it in order to use it, however private and local deployments are also possible.

A demo deployment of the latest release of Geppetto is available `here <https://live.geppetto.org>`__ while the binaries are available to `download here <https://github.com/openworm/org.geppetto/releases/>`__.

The documentation is split into two main sections: a guide to help you learn how to use Geppetto and the developers documentation to learn how Geppetto is engineered and how to contribute to it.
