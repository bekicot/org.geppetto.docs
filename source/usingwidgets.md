Widgets
=======

Geppetto has a modular architecture that allows to visualize and
interact with the data through different widgets. Widgets are an
essential aspect of the user interface of Geppetto. You can imagine them
as "at-a-glance" views of data and functionality that is accessible
right from the browser. Users can move widgets across the screen, resize
them and interact with their functionality through their API or the
provided UI.

To see what widgets are available in Geppetto the user can type in the
console the command

``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
G.availableWidgets()
```

which would return a list like this:

``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
{"PLOT":0,"POPUP":1,"SCATTER3D":2,"TREEVISUALISERDAT":3,"TREEVISUALISERD3":4,"VARIABLEVISUALISER":5,"CONNECTIVITY":6, "BUTTONBAR":7}
```

Specific documentation on different widget types are available below:

-   A plot widget shows a line graph of data tied to variables that are
    changing in a simulation
-   A popup widget can display arbitrary text to annotate / document a
    model
-   A Scatter 3D widget shows a scatter plot
-   A TreeVisualizer DAT widget shows model properties in a hierarchical
    tree view.
-   A Variable visualizer widget displays the changing values of a
    variable
-   A Connectivity widget displays connections between neurons in
    a network.
-   A Button Bar widget that allows the user to define a bar with any
    number of custom buttons.

In order to instantiate a widget the user can use the command

``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
G.addWidget(TREEVISUALISERDAT)
```

or

``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
G.addWidget(3)
```

For more information see the documentation related to each individual
widget. If you are interested in contributing a new widget to Geppetto
you can follow this tutorial <contributewidgets>.
