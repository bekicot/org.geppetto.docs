Background
----------

The decision to build Geppetto came after an analysis of the
requirements for a platform to support a full-scale simulation of the C.
elegans and potentially even more complex organisms in times to come.
Beside the functional requirements, Geppetto's goal is to move away from
the common monolithic approach usually found in academic software
projects. Geppetto is an [open source
project](https://github.com/openworm/org.geppetto/blob/master/README.md)
and engineers, scientists and developers are welcome to contribute to
its development by adding functionalities to existing plugins or writing
new ones without having to deal with millions of lines of code with no
clearly defined boundaries.

Computational neuroscience has produced software systems, including
NEURON and Genesis, that are extremely useful for simulating systems of
neurons that include biophysical details ([Brette et al,
2007](http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio.NC/0611089)). There also exist a range
of other algorithms devised in other areas of computational biology
([Barnes & Chu, 2010](http://g.ua/MhoV)) for which simulators have been
produced ([Takahashi,
2004](http://web.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~shafi/takahashi-thesis.pdf)). Several
investigations have pointed to the challenges in building a single
system that integrates multiple simulation algorithms together into a
single biological model ([Takahashi et al., 2002](http://g.ua/Mhx1),
[Dada and Mendes, 2007](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-02879-3) ,
[Cornelis et al., 2012](http://g.ua/Mhxa) ).

Geppetto aims to address these scientific challenges along with some
engineering ones. Geppetto's design leverages cutting edge software
technologies and its architecture and development follows industry
standards.

The architecture
----------------

The analysis of the requirements for Geppetto resulted in a clearly
identified set of architectural features that have driven its
development:

### *Modular*

Geppetto allows separation of functionality into independent,
interchangeable modules such that each contains everything necessary to
execute a given aspect of desired functionality.

### *Scalable*

Geppetto can handle a growing amount of work in a robust fashion by
being intrinsically distributed, scaling up to accomodate growing load.

### *Extensible*

Geppetto allows for future growth by including hooks and mechanisms for
expanding/enhancing the system with anticipated capabilities, without
having to make ad-hoc changes to the system infrastructure.

### *Generic*

Geppetto is not tied to any specific biological simulation, nor to the
model being simulated or the simulation aspects (neuronal, mechanical,
etc.) being simulated.

### *Client-Server*

Geppetto is based on a client-server model, where the simulation is
controlled by a client through a web interface.

### *Distributed*

Geppetto architecture needs to allow separation of the execution of a
simulation into multiple processes which can be executed by different
server and which communicate with each other by exchanging messages.

### *Dynamic deployment*

Geppetto components can be deployed, re-deployed, and un-deployed
without a system (server) restart.

Technology stack
----------------

Geppetto is written in JAVA on top of the [OSGi
framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi). This enables us to build
modules as “OSGi bundles”, independent components that allow for clean
separations between functional areas that are simulating different
aspects of a bio-physical system.

On top of OSGi, [Spring](http://www.springsource.org/about) has been
chosen as the glue-framework to assemble a complex system from a set of
loosely-coupled components (POJOs) in a consistent and transparent
fashion.

Geppetto OSGi based bundles are deployed on the [Eclipse
Virgo](http://www.eclipse.org/virgo/) WebServer.

Status
------

Geppetto is currently in development. A version is [released every
month](https://github.com/openworm/org.geppetto/releases/) with new
added features. While the Geppetto platform is engineered with a generic
framework capable of encapsulating any algorithm into a module, the
[OpenWorm project](http://www.openworm.org) has begun implementing
specific modules to meet the particular challenges of its domain. The
OpenWorm case study has led to the development of one module to simulate
the electrophysiology of neuronal cells and networks, and another to
simulate fluid-mechanics based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics
(SPH) algorithm ([Solenthaler
2011](http://www.zora.uzh.ch/29724/1/Barbara.pdf) ). SPH provides the
ability to simulate soft tissues and their interface to liquids of
varying viscosities, which in turn allows for the simulation of forces
created by muscles pulling on a non-rigid body.

Feedback
--------

Geppetto is being developed to combine cutting edge science into an
industry grade software platform. The open source nature is essential in
this process and so is your feedback. If you have any question please
[email us](mailto:info@geppetto.org) . If you wish to raise a bug,
request a feature or an enhancement please do so by logging an
[issue](https://github.com/openworm/org.geppetto/issues) . If the issues
is related to a specific module (e.g.
[frontend](https://github.com/openworm/org.geppetto.frontend/issues) ,
[fluid mechanics
simulator](https://github.com/openworm/org.geppetto.simulator.sph/issues)
, etc.) you can log it directly on it.
