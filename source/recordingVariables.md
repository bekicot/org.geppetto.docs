Recording Variables
===================

Note: Recording variables and running simulations are only possible in
Geppetto deployments that support these functionalities.

Any state variable that exists in the model can be recorded prior to
running a simulation, meaning it will be possible to subsequently plot
its values once the simulation is complete.

You can record a variable by searching for it in the search bar (open it
using the little search icon on the left hand side of the screen

or pressing Ctrl+Space) and clicking on the Record icon

The icon signifying state variables that can be recorded is the
superscript icon:
