The Events
----------

Geppetto has a class called GEPPETTO.Events.js that declares a set of
events that widgets can register and listen to. These events are the
result of user interaction with the environment; selection, restarting
simulation, loading simulation.

``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
var Events = {
        Select : "simulation:selection_changed",
        Simulation_restarted : "simulation:restarted",
        Simulation_loaded : 'simulation:modelloaded',
    };
```

If a widget is registered to listen to an event, it will receive updates
once such event takes place in Geppetto.

Registering a Widget to an Event ================= At the moment
TreeVisualizerDAT1 is the only widget with a method that allows it to
register to listen to the Geppetto Events described above. To use it,
call the register event method and pass it the event to which you want
the widget to listen.

``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
TreeVisualizerDAT1.registerEvent(Events.Select);
```

In our example above our widget would be registered to the selection
event, and will receive updates every time the selection changes in
Geppetto.
