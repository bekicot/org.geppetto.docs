Geppetto Concepts
=================

Model
-----

A Model describes a specific aspect of an entity. A Model could describe
an entity as a particle system, while another model could describe its
biophysical properties. A model is simulated by a specific simulator
bundle.

Simulation
----------

A Simulation is the top level controller of Geppetto. A simulation is
configured through a file which describes what entities and models are
to be simulated.

Simulator
---------

A Simulator is directly responsible to simulate a class of models by
employing one or more solvers. A simulator can be seen as a controller
which drives the solvers to compute one or more simulation steps on the
models it is responsible for.

Conversion
----------

A Conversion is in charge of converting a model from one format to
another. This conversion service takes place between the model
interpreter (the service which generates a Geppetto Model from a set of
files) and the simulator. This conversion service can be specified by
the user in the simulation file or automatically invoke by Geppetto.
Geppetto will automatically call this service if the output format of
the model interpreter doesn't match any of the input formats in the
simulation.

Solver
------

A Solver is the lowest level component of the simulation stack and is in
charge of mathematical computation. Generic solvers (e.g. ODE,PDE,etc.)
can be reused across different simulators while specific one can be
implemented ad-hoc for a specific algorithm (e.g. SPH).
